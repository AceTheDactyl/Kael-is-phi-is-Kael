# Research #2: [Open Slot]

This research folder is reserved for future investigation.

## Potential Directions

- **Cosmology**: Dark matter/energy in the hidden E₈ sector
- **Quantum Gravity**: φ-structure at the Planck scale
- **Consciousness**: The Kaelhedron sector as awareness substrate
- **Information Theory**: φ-based entropy and complexity
- **Neural Networks**: K-formation in artificial systems

## Getting Started

1. Create your main module(s)
2. Add comprehensive tests
3. Update this README with your research direction
4. Connect back to the core Kaelhedron framework
