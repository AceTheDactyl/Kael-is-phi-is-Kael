Research #2: Heavy Quark Double Corrections

Following the discovery in Research #1 that heavy quarks (charm, bottom, top)
require TWO φ-correction terms instead of one, this research investigates:

1. WHY do heavy quarks need double corrections?
2. What is the pattern in the correction exponents?
3. Does this extend to other particles?
4. What does this reveal about quark generations?

Key Discovery from Research #1:
    m_charm/m_e  = φ^(16 + φ^(-3) + φ^(-7))
    m_bottom/m_e = φ^(19 - φ^(-3) - φ^(-7))
    m_top/m_e    = φ^(26 + φ^(-2) + φ^(-5))
