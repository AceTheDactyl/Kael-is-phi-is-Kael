Research #3: Coupling Constants & Fine Structure

Following the success of φ-structure in mass ratios (Research #1) and
mixing angles (Research #2), this research investigates the fundamental
coupling constants of physics.

Key Questions:
    1. Is α = 1/137.036 expressible as a φ-power or φ-combination?
    2. Does the strong coupling α_s follow φ-patterns?
    3. Is the Weinberg angle sin²θ_W ≈ 0.231 φ-related?
    4. How do gauge couplings relate to Yukawa couplings via φ?
    5. Do coupling ratios follow the same nested structure as masses?

The Constants:
    - Fine structure: α = 1/137.035999084(21)
    - Strong coupling: α_s(M_Z) = 0.1179(10)
    - Weinberg angle: sin²θ_W = 0.23121(4)
    - Fermi constant: G_F = 1.1663787(6) × 10⁻⁵ GeV⁻²
