Research #6: Neutrino Sector & Rigorous Statistical Defense

This research combines:
1. Deep analysis of neutrino masses and PMNS structure
2. Rigorous response to Kimi's statistical methodology concerns
3. Proper treatment of look-elsewhere effect and Occam penalties

Key questions to address:
- Can we predict neutrino mass ratios BEFORE fitting?
- What is the TRUE statistical significance after all corrections?
- Is the framework falsifiable with quantitative criteria?
