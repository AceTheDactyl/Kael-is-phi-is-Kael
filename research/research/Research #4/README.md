# Research #4: [Open Slot]

This research folder is reserved for future investigation.

## Potential Directions

- **Lean Proofs**: Formalize physics claims in Lean 4
- **Category Theory**: φ as morphism, K-formation as functor
- **Topology**: 7-manifolds and exceptional structures
- **Number Theory**: φ-powers in prime distribution
- **Algebraic Geometry**: E₈ moduli spaces

## Getting Started

1. Create your main module(s)
2. Add comprehensive tests
3. Update this README with your research direction
4. Connect back to the core Kaelhedron framework
