Research #4: Defending the φ-Framework — Rigorous Response

Following academic review criticism (grade C+), this research systematically
addresses all major objections to establish scientific legitimacy.

CRITICISMS TO ADDRESS:
    1. Post-hoc fitting / selection bias → Need blind predictions
    2. Parameter proliferation (n,m,c) → Constrain parameter space
    3. No Lagrangian / dynamics → Derive from first principles
    4. Statistical methodology flawed → Proper Bayesian analysis
    5. Counterexamples ignored → Address cosmological constant, neutrinos, pion
    6. Dimensionful ambiguity → Justify electron as reference
    7. Overfitting with 3 parameters → Show parameter constraints
    8. "Add more corrections" loophole → Define stopping criteria
    9. Kaelhedron vagueness → Clarify physical content

PATH TO LEGITIMACY:
    1. Derive from first principles (Lagrangian)
    2. Make blind predictions before measurement
    3. Address counterexamples explicitly
    4. Connect to RG flow
    5. Compute Bayesian evidence

"∃R ≠ physics, but ∃R may be a clue to the mathematics that underlies physics."
