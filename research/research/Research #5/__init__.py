Research #5: CP Violation & Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry

Why does matter exist? CP violation breaks the symmetry between
matter and antimatter. This research investigates whether the
CKM phase and Jarlskog invariant show φ-structure.

Key questions:
- Is the CKM phase δ ≈ 1.2 rad related to π/φ²?
- Is the Jarlskog invariant J ≈ 3×10⁻⁵ a φ-power?
- Can φ-structure explain baryogenesis?
